# #TeamStat

TeamStat is a single page application, built in AngularJs 1.3 and Firebase. It allows teams to quickly see what each member is up to by giving each member a place to update their status on projects.

## Installation

To copy the TeamStat app for your own team, download the .zip file and edit the 'members.json' file. You'll want to change out the 'firstname' and 'email' properties of each team member object.

You will also have to install Gulp web-util and web-server to run the app off of Gulp.

## Usage

Simply open up the app, and click on either 'View Team' or 'Add Someone'. Click on a team member to see their project status and updates.


## Credits

Shout out to my good friend and fellow hacker, Mateo Clarke, for the original ScrumBoard idea.
